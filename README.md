# Neural Machine Translation using PyTorch and HuggingFace

This repository is a homework assignment for a DL course. The task was to implement a neural machine translation model using PyTorch and HuggingFace.

The main focus of the project is to compare a vanilla Transformer model to a pre-trained T5-small model. The results of this comparison can be found in the provided Jupyter notebook.
